  title: " Doctoral Student"
  description: "Currently working towards my doctoral studies in the field of
    Mechanical engineering at Nano composites and Mechanics (NCM) lab at
    University of New Brunswick, Fredericton. My research focus is on developing
    nano composite (ceramic-metallic) powders tailored for high pressure cold
    spray (HPCS) by applying statistical principles to optimize research design
    followed by deposition using HPCS. The objective of NCM lab is to create
    high-strength HPCS coatings and additive manufacturing (AM) components
    driven by the need for industry relevant solutions.   I graduated from
    Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (IIT KGP) with bachelors and
    masters in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering. As a Materials engineer,
    my primary area of interest and focus is understanding the role and
    importance of materials in the world we live in.  With an interest in
    concurrent technologies and desire to be a part of an ambitious research
    driven environment, I have taken up my doctoral studies at UNB.  My research
    interests include High Pressure Cold Spray, Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) based AM
    technologies, Alloy Design, Statistical modelling & analysis and Material
    characterization. I am also currently working as a teaching assistant at
    Manufacturing process laboratory. "
description: " I am driven by my curiosity to understand the world we live in.
  My fascination with the universe manifests in the form of my interest in
  science, love for the art and curiosity of the human history and biological
  evolution. I like to read about history, biology, physics, philosophy and
  anything that broadens my understanding of the universe. However, I am also
  enthralled and captured by the abstract nature of the universe manifested in
  the form of music/vibrations. I appreciate classical and progressive rock
  music and forms of visual art."
